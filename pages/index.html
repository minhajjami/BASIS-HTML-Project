       <h1><mark>What is HTML?</mark></h1>
       <p>Hypertext Markup Language <abbr title="Hypertext Markup Language ">(HTML)</abbr> is the standard markup language for creating web pages and web applications. With Cascading Style Sheets<abbr title="Cascading Style Sheets"> (CSS)</abbr> and JavaScript it forms a triad of cornerstone technologies for the World Wide Web.[1] Web browsers receive HTML documents from a web server or from local storage and render them into multimedia web pages. <em>HTML describes the structure of a web page semantically and originally included cues for the appearance of the document.</em>
       <pre>
      	HTML elements are the building blocks of HTML pages. With HTML <cite>constructs, images and other objects,
        such as interactive forms,</cite> may be embedded into the rendered page. 
        It provides a means to create structured documents by denoting structural semantics for text such as
        headings, paragraphs, lists, links, quotes and other items. HTML elements are delineated by tags,
        written using angle brackets. Tags such as <u>"img" and"input"</u>introduce content into the page 
        directly. Others such as surround and provide information about document text and may
        include other tags as sub-elements. Browsers do not display the HTML tags, but use them to interpret
        the content of the page.
       </pre>
       <q>HTML can embed programs written in a scripting language such as JavaScript which affect the behavior and content of web pages</q>. <u>Inclusion of CSS defines the look and layout of content.</u> The World Wide Web Consortium (W3C), maintainer of both the HTML and the CSS standards, has encouraged the use of CSS over explicit presentational HTML since 1997

				<i>Lorem Ipsum</i> is simply dummy text of the <b>printing and typesetting </b>industry. <i>Lorem Ipsum</i> has been the industry's standard dummy text ever since the <del>1499s</del> 1500s, when an unknown printer took a galley of type and scrambled it to make a type specimen book. It has survived not only five centuries, but also the leap into electronic typesetting, remaining essentially unchanged. It was popularised in the <ins>1960s</ins> with the release of Letraset sheets containing Lorem Ipsum passages, and more recently with desktop publishing software like Aldus PageMaker including versions of <i>Lorem Ipsum</i>.</p>

				<p>It is a long established fact that a reader will be distracted by the readable content of a page when looking at its layout. The point of using Lorem Ipsum is that it has a more-or-less normal distribution of letters, as opposed to using <strong>'Content here, content here'</strong>, making it look like readable English. Many desktop publishing packages and web page editors now use <ins>Lorem Ipsum as their default model text, and a search for 'lorem ipsum'</ins> will uncover many web sites still in their infancy. Various versions have evolved over the years, sometimes by accident, sometimes on purpose <del>(injected humour and the like</del></p>
